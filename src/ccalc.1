.SH NAME
ccalc \- evaluate C expressions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ccalc
.RI [ "OPTION" "...] " EXPRESSION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ccalc
is a quick and lightweight command-line calculator, ideal for
performing quick calculations from the terminal. This is often faster and
easier than invoking an interactive or graphical program. The
"EXAMPLES" section can help you get started quickly.
.PP
.I ccalc
takes an arithmetic expression as an argument, it evaluates this expression,
and then it prints the result. The expression is assumed to follow the syntax
of the C programming language. All C operators are supported except for those
with side-effects (namely assignment, increment, and decrement). A few
mathematical constants like
.IR PI " and " E
are defined, and most of the math
functions in the C standard library are available.
.PP
Both integer and floating-point values may be used in the input expression.
When possible,
.I ccalc
uses integer operations. If a floating-point value
is given explicitly, or if an operation results in a non-integer value, then
floating-point arithmetic is used for the remainder of the calculation. Note
that unlike in C, integer division is not performed by default. The
.B //
operator may be used instead of
.B /
to guarantee an integer result.
.PP
Integer values may also be specified in binary, octal, or hexadecimal. Binary
values should be prefixed with '0b', octal values with '0', and hexadecimal
values with '0x'.
.I ccalc
can also display its results in different bases; see the "OPTIONS" section
below for details.
.PP
As in C, the caret
.B ^
is used for bitwise XOR and not for exponentiation. This behavior can be
changed with the
.B -c
option. Exponentiation can also be performed by using the
.B pow
function or, unlike in C, the
.B **
operator.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are also mandatory for the corresponding
short option.
.TP
.B -b, --binary
Print integer results in binary (base 2).
.TP
.B --bool
Interpret the result as a boolean value and print
.BR true " or " false.
.TP
.B -c, --caret-exp
.RB "Use caret " ^ " for exponentiation rather than for bitwise XOR."
.TP
.B -d, --degrees
Use degrees instead of radians for trigonometric functions.
.TP
.BI "-g, --grouping=" DIGITS
.RI "Group each set of " DIGITS " digits and separate each group with spaces"
.RB "(use " "-g 0" " for no grouping)."
.TP
.B -o, --octal
Print integer results in octal (base 8).
.TP
.BI "-p, --precision=" DIGITS
.RI "Print floating-point results with " DIGITS " digits after the decimal"
point (default 6).
.TP
.BI "-r, --radix=" RADIX
.RI "Print integer results in base " RADIX .
.TP
.B -s, --scientific-notation
Always print floating-point results in scientific notation: [-]d.dddeÂ±dd
.TP
.B -t, --time
Show how much time the computation took.
.TP
.B -u, --uppercase
Use uppercase letters in output instead of lowercase (e.g. for digits in bases
greater than 10).
.TP
.B -x, --hexadecimal
Print integer results in hexadecimal (base 16).
.TP
.B -?, --help
Display a help message with detailed usage information and exit.
.TP
.B --usage
Give a short usage message and exit.
.TP
.B --version
Display version information and exit.
.SH OPERATORS
The following operations are supported, in order of decreasing precedence:
.IP
.RB "grouping " () ","
.IP
.RB "exponentiation " ** ","
.IP
.RB "logical negation " ! ", bitwise negation " ~ ", unary " + " and " - ","
.IP
.RB "multiplication " * ", division " / ", integer division " // ,
.RB "modulo " % ","
.IP
.RB "addition " + ", subtraction " - ","
.IP
.RB "bit shifts " << " and " >> ","
.IP
.RB "relational comparison " < ", " <= ", " > ", and " >= ","
.IP
.RB "equality comparison " == " and " != ","
.IP
.RB "bitwise AND " & ","
.IP
.RB "bitwise XOR " ^ ","
.IP
.RB "bitwise OR " | ","
.IP
.RB "logical AND " && ","
.IP
.RB "logical OR " || ","
.IP
.RB "ternary conditional expression " ?: ","
.IP
.RB "comma " , "."
.PP
All operators have left-to-right associativity except for the unary operators, 
the exponentiation operator, and the conditional expression. The modulus 
.RB "operator " % " and the bitwise operators " & ", " | ", " ^ ","
.BR << ", " >> ", and " ~ " only work with integer values."
.PP
The assignment operators and the unary increment and decrement
operators from C are not supported.
