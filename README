Usage: ccalc [OPTION...] EXPRESSION
Evaluate the C-style EXPRESSION and display the result. If no expression is
given, read from standard input.

  -b, --binary               Print integer results in binary (base 2)
      --bool                 Interpret the result as a boolean value and print
                             true or false
  -d, --degrees              Use degrees instead of radians for trigonometric
                             functions
  -e                         Use caret ^ for exponentiation rather than for
                             bitwise XOR
  -o, --octal                Print integer results in octal (base 8)
  -p, --precision=DIGITS     Print floating-point results with DIGITS digits
                             after the decimal point (default 6)
  -r, --radix=RADIX          Print integer results in base RADIX
  -t, --time                 Show how much time the computation took
  -u, --uppercase            Use uppercase rather than lowercase letters for
                             digits in bases greater than 10
  -x, --hexadecimal          Print integer results in hexadecimal (base 16)
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
      --version              Display version information and exit

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.

The EXPRESSION is interpreted as a C expression and evaluated. Integer
operations are used when possible. If a floating-point value is given
explicitly, or if an operation results in a non-integer value, then
floating-point arithmetic is used for the remainder of the calculation.

WARNING: The caret ^ indicates bitwise XOR, like in C, and not
exponentiation. This behavior can be changed with the '-e' option.
Exponentiation can also be performed using the pow function or (unlike in C)
the ** operator.

Many mathematical functions from the C standard library are available. Common
mathematical constants like PI and E are also defined. Consult the program
documentation for a complete list.

Exit status:
0  if the calculation completed successfully,
1  if an invalid expression was given,
2  if a system error occurred.
