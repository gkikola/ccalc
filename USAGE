Usage: ccalc [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION]
Evaluate the C-style EXPRESSION and display the result. If no expression is
given, read from standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -b, --binary               print result in binary (base 2)
      --bool                 interpret the result as a boolean value and print
                               true or false
  -e                         use caret ^ for exponentiation rather than for XOR
  -o, --octal                print result in octal (base 8)
  -r, --radix=RADIX          print result in base RADIX
  -t, --time                 show how much time the computation took
  -x, --hexadecimal          print result in hexadecimal (base 16)
      --help                 display this help and exit
      --version              output version information and exit

The EXPRESSION is interpreted as a C expression and evaluated. Integer
operations are used when possible. If a floating-point value is given
explicitly, or if an operation results in a non-integer value, then floating-
point arithmetic is used for the remainder of the calculation.

WARNING: As in C, the caret ^ is used as the bitwise XOR operator and not for
exponentiation. This behavior can be changed with the -e option.
Exponentiation can also be performed by using the pow function.

Many mathematical functions from the C standard library are available. Common
mathematical constants like PI and E are also defined. Consult the man pages
for a complete list.

Exit status:
 0  if calculation completed successfully,
 1  if an invalid expression is given.
